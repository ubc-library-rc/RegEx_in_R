# Example of RegEx in action

## Look for mtches in vector
We will use an example of a regular expression in R that is built into the tidyverse package. 

```r
## install tidyverse (only do this once on your computer)
install.packages("tidyverse)

## load tidyverse (do this every time you use R)
library(tidyverse)

## example from str_replace in stringr, a package in the package tidyverse
fruits = c("one apple", "two pears", "three bananas")
fruits
fruits.re = str_replace(fruits, "[aeiou]", "-")
fruits.re
```
### What is the computer doing here?
In the fruits example, R looks for the letters within the [] <em>[aeiou]</em> within the <em>fruits</em> vector. Anytime R finds any of the letters in [], it replaces them with a desh (-). This illustrates a critical part of regular expressions, "any matches" is the default way that the computer will look for matches. To get around this, you can exclude matches.

## Look for matches, but exclude some based on a condition.
