## Note: this workshop is in development and not yet complete.

In this workshop, we will learn about regular expressions (regex). We will go over what they are and when to use them and then have lots of time to practice.

We assume some initial experience with R. If the material covered in beginner <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/Beginner_R_Part1/" target="_blank">part 1</a> and <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/Beginner_R_Part2/" target="_blank">part 2</a> are familiar, the topics covered today should be managable. 

The library also has a <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-regex/" target="_blank"> general regex workshop </a> that provides helpful information about regex in general, which will help familiarize you with the regex syntax we cover in this workshop. 

Being familiar with the <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro_to_tidyverse/" target="_blank">tidyverse package</a> may be beneficial, but we do not expect all participants to be familiar with the tidyverse syntax. 

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will have learned:
1. What regular expressions are.
2. When is using regular expressions is useful.
3. Gotten some hands on practice with regular expressions in R.
